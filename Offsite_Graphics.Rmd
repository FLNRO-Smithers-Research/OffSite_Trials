Distribution of offsite species trials by BGC and climate space

Plot on map
Count by BGC
Count by time period (>30, 20-30, 10-19, 6-10)
Plot trials by DD5 by CMD.adjust


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(data.table)
require(tidyverse)
library(readr)
require(tictoc)

## the first data.frame is the template
trials.merge <-  function(df1, df2) {
  trial.data.cols <- colnames(df1)
Missing <- setdiff(trial.data.cols, names(df2))
df2 <- as.data.frame(df2)
df2 [Missing] <- NA # Add columns, filled with 'NA's
df2 <- df2[trial.data.cols]  
df <- rbind(df1, df2)
df
}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r import tables exported from ACCESS data set}
offsite_spp <- c("FDI", "FDC", "LW", "PY", "PW", "CW","BA", "BG", "PA", "YC", "BN", "BP", "LS", "FD")
offsite.trials <- fread("./clean_data/Combined_Offsite_Trial_Info.csv") %>% filter(Latitude > 52)
offsite.planting <- fread("./clean_data/Combined_Offsite_Planting_Info.csv") %>% mutate(SppVar = toupper(SppVar)) %>% filter(SppVar %in% offsite_spp)
```

```{r create Avenza data set}
Offsite.climate <- 

Offsite.bybec <- left_join(offsite.trials, offsite.planting) %>% droplevels() 



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
